The game is a shooter minigame designed to try to score a highest score inspired by other 
retro styled games.

You walk with WASD, and shoot with IJKL.

Health drops on occasion as little red diamonds.
Power ups drop on occasion that change the way the bullets work.
The player has 3 lifes.
A lot of the difficulty came with calculating projectiles and ensuring all the collisions were dealt with.
